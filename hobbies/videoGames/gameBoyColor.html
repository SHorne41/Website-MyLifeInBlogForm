<p>When it came to giving us our Christmas gifts, my parents have always tried to mix it up. They avoided giving us what they thought would
be the gift that we were most excited for until the end, fearing that we wouldn't show any enthusiasm for any of our other gifts. This was a
great strategy, in my opinion; for as long as I can remember, there was always one gift that I wanted desperately more than others. I
think this will be a technique that I will one day use when giving my own kids their gifts on Christmas.<br></p>

<p>In the summer of 1999, my dad was posted back to Ontario from Alberta (Edmonton to Petawawa to be more specific). So this was our first
Christmas in our new house, and the first Christmas I can recall from my childhood. When we had arrived in July, our neighbours had a son named Chris (who's
dad's name was also Chris, if I remember correctly). He was somewhat older than me; I think he may have been 10 or so. In any case, I recall
sitting on the retaining wall between my yard and his, and he was playing Pokemon Red on a classic GameBoy. I thought it was so cool. I'd sit
there for hours just watching him play, and he'd teach me about the different Pokemon as we went along. I can't remember if I had already known
about Pokemon prior to this, but I definitely remember thinking it was really cool. Chris was also the one who showed me that you could make the
game glitch out, allowing you to catch Missingno (for missing number)! I don't remember exactly how to perform the glitch, but I remember watching
him surf along the edge of one of the islands at Cinnibar.<br></p>

<p>From that point on, I wanted to get a GameBoy of my very own so that I could begin my quest to be the Pokemon Master. This desire was further
established thanks in large part to my lengthy commute to school (over 1 hour one-way). Needless to say, that year I asked Santa Claus for a
GameBoy, as well as a copy of Pokemon. Now, given that I was only 6 years old, I had no idea that Nintendo had since come out with the GameBoy
Color, nor was I aware that they had also published the second generation of Pokemon titles: Gold & Silver (with Crystal published later).
Thankfully, my parents were savy enough to purchase the newest implementations of both.<br></p>

<p>Now, as I mentioned above, my parents would always keep
our most exciting gifts for the very end. However, what I forgot to mention is that they also used gift-giving for their own twisted pleasure.
On this particular occasion, they thought it would be funny to give me my copy of Pokemon Gold early on during the proceedings. I was
incredibly excited, understandably, anticipating that my GameBoy was to follow. However, each gift I opened afterwards failed to include the
system required to play my prized possession. One all the gifts had been opened (with the exception of my GameBoy, which wasn't under the tree),
my parents informed me that I would have to save up in order to purchase the GameBoy. I was devastated. I very seldom ever received any money
in lieu of gifts. They said I could always ask for it for my birthday. Despite knowing my birthday was only a few short months away, to a
6-year-old, that's like an eternity. Only once I was on the verge of tears did my mom "remember" that a gift was missing, at which point she had
my dad run to their bedroom and grab my GameBoy. At the time, I thought they were monsters. But now, looking back on it, I can see the humour in it.</p>
